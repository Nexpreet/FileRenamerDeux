# FileRenamer
File renamer (but I maybe actually make it) made in C, pretty much purpose-built for pirating music 

Tool is made for Windows because file explorer sucks and CMD is even worse.\
Making it for myself so it's probably really unsafe when it comes to backing up your file-name data.\
Writing in C cause it's just superior compared to everything else, especially Java 🤮

Oh yeah, here are some emojis cause that's what every readme needs 

💀 Deletes crap\
🤪 Adds crap (dragana emoji)\
🤓 Sorts crap alphabetically and inverse alphabetically\
🐟 Has a nice file input stream (fis == vis ! 🐟)\

/s
